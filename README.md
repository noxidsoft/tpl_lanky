# tpl_lanky
###Description:###
This is our first template in 2012 and kicks off our future proposal for a template club primarily delivering generic templates for government around the world on the Joomla CMS framework.

There are no third party frameworks running behind our templates, nor will there ever be. We believe in NOT locking people and business into vendor only approaches as this creates an in-flexible end result that builds unrealistic learning curves. So, if you know a little about Joomla and how to install a template, set basic parameters, rearrange module positions, you will have little to do but switch it on and start using immediately.

###Usage:###
Install as you would any other template extension into your Joomla 2.5.x website. The template manipulates the basic functionality of the Joomla display affecting menu's, blog layouts, article styles and more.

See 'Module suffices' below to know about the different module positional styles.

###Basic options (parameters), default settings are:###
Site width |100%|

###Module Class Suffix (Advance Options):###
_box1

_box3
Double line bordered module with hollow circle bullet points and dark read title.

No suffix (leaving it blank)
Produces non-bordered module with solid bullet point and greyish-blue title / body text. Quite plain.
